# Filet

Filet is a dsl for acceptance testing on top of Test::Unit.

## Installation

    gem install filet

## Usage

To use filet just include in your test_helper

    require 'filet'
    include Filet

## Hooks

We provide several hooks for options processing.

1. Filet.feature_hook

This allows to process the options you pass for the feature

    Filet.feature_hook do |base, options|
      base.send(:include, Capybara)
    end

2. Filet.context_hook

This allows to process the options you pass for the context

    Filet.context_hook do |base, options|
      base.send(:include, SomeModule) if options[:js]
    end
